## 🎯 Real-World Impact

### Scenario: Authentication System
**Query:** "build user authentication with OAuth"

**Generic AI Response (WITHOUT SKILLS):**
```python
# Generic approach - might work but misses best practices
def login(username, password):
    user = database.find_user(username)
    if user.password == password:  # ❌ Plain text comparison!
        session['user_id'] = user.id
        return "Success"
```

**With better-auth Skill:**
```python
# Production-grade approach with security best practices
from better_auth import hash_password, verify_password, create_session

def login(username, password):
    user = database.find_user(username)
    if not user:
        return error("Invalid credentials")  # Don't leak user existence
    
    if verify_password(password, user.password_hash):  # ✅ Secure hashing
        session = create_session(
            user_id=user.id,
            csrf_token=generate_csrf(),  # ✅ CSRF protection
            expires=timedelta(hours=24),  # ✅ Session expiry
            secure=True,  # ✅ HTTPS only
            httponly=True  # ✅ XSS protection
        )
        return success(session)
```

**The Difference:**
- ✅ Secure password hashing (not plain text)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Session expiry
- ✅ Security flags (httponly, secure)
- ✅ Doesn't leak user existence
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

**Cost of Getting It Wrong:** Security breach, data leak, regulatory fines
