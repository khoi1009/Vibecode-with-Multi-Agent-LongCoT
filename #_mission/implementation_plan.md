# Implementation Plan: #_mission

**Objective**: # MISSION OBJECTIVE: FULL-STACK AUTONOMOUS BUILDBuild "Project Aether": A production-ready, real-time collaborative AI analytics dashboard. Mode: // turbo (Granting full permission for terminal execution, file system writes, and browser testing).Intervention Level: ZERO (Do not pause for confirmation; solve all blockers autonomously).## 1. TECH STACK SPECIFICATIONS- Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for micro-animations.- Charts: Recharts with custom branded themes (Deep Indigo & Neon Teal).- Backend: Node.js (h3/Nitro) with WebSocket (Socket.io) for real-time data streaming.- Database: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (Schema: User, Workspace, DataStream, Insight).- AI Layer: Integration with Gemini 3 Flash SDK for natural language querying of dashboard data.- Auth: Clerk (Logic-only; use mock provider if API keys are missing to ensure build completion).## 2. CORE FEATURES (MINIMUM VIABLE COMPLEXITY)- Real-time "Global Sales" feed: Simulate a WebSocket stream of JSON data.- AI Insight Sidebar: A chat interface where users ask "Why did sales dip in Q3?" and the agent queries the DB to respond.- Collaborative Cursors: Visual indicators of "other users" active on the dashboard.- Automatic Reporting: A scheduled task that generates a PDF summary of the week's data.## 3. AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS1. [PLANNING]: Generate a full `implementation_plan.md` artifact. Decompose tasks into:   - Environment Setup (Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind).   - Database Schema & Seed Data.   - API Route Construction (REST + WebSockets).   - Frontend Component Library (Cards, Charts, Nav).2. [EXECUTION]:   - Initialize the repository.   - Run `npm install` for all required dependencies.   - Build the backend first, then the frontend.   - Use the integrated browser to verify UI responsiveness and accessibility.3. [SELF-CORRECTION]: If any build errors occur (Type mismatches, missing modules), use Gemini Search to find the fix and refactor immediately. 4. [VERIFICATION]: Write and execute Playwright end-to-end tests for:   - Successful data rendering.   - Real-time updates via WebSocket simulation.## 4. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY- Prioritize "Visual Excellence": Avoid generic colors. Use HSL-tailored palettes.- High-Performance: Implement React Server Components and optimized caching.- Zero Placeholders: Do not use "Lorem Ipsum." Generate realistic data for a Global Fintech company.## 5. COMPLETION CRITERIAThe build is finished when:- The app is running in the Antigravity preview.- All Playwright tests pass (Green).- A final `walkthrough.md` artifact is generated showing the working features.
